# Python Roadmap Journey


I'm learning Python development, and this is my roadmap. I will add new steps as I learn, and I'll include some basic concepts that I already know in these steps.



    
Introduction to Python:

Google can provide you with a better introduction, but for the sake of this diary, I'm going to provide as much information as I know.
Python is a high-level programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. Python itself is written in the C programming language.


Python's Applications:

1.    Backend web development
2.    Software development
3.    System scripting
4.    Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)
5.    Machine Learning
6.    Data Science
7.    Data Analytics
